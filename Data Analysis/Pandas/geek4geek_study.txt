1. create dataframe

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame()

create df from (dict/list)

iloc only integer, loc by index

binary operation on series:
add(), sub(), mul(), div(), sum(), prod(), mean(), pow(), abs(), cov()

pandas series method

count() - return number of non-NA observations in the Series
size() - number of elements in the underlying data
name() method allows to give a name to a Series
is_unique()
idxmax() - extract the index positino of the highest values in a series
idxmin() - index position of the lowest values in a series
sort_values()
sort_index()
head()
tail()
le() less and equal to
eq()
ne() not equal
ge() greater and equal 
gt()
lt()
astype() - change data type 
tolist() - convert a series to list
get() - extract values from a series, alternative to the traditional bracket

value_counts() count the number of times each unique value occurs in a series
factorize()
map()
between()
apply()

perc = [.2, .4, .6, .8]
describe(percentile =, include, exclude): percentile to include in the output,
all should fall between 0 and 1. The default is [.25, .5, .75], which returns the 25th, 50th
, and 75th percentiles; include: all list-like of dtype or None, optional, 'all' all columns of the input will be included
in the output
include = ['object', 'float', 'int']

df = pd.concat([new, df].reset_index(drop = True)), df add below new
