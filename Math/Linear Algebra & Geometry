Only square matrices have inverse

rectangular matrices can have an inverse (left/right).

Invertible:
1) det A not equal to 0
full rank
n pivot position
non singular

column space mxn
rank + nullity = n
rank A <= min(m,n)

the col space and row space hace same dimension r. The nullspace has dimension n-r. Null Null(A^T) has dimension m-r
differentiation and integration is linear 

injection: one to one (range could be unmatch)
surjection: onto (range could match 2 elements in domain)
bijection: injection + surjection

linear transformation are matrix transformation

Rn -> Rm produces an mxn matrix
mxn matrix produces a linear transformation

image space = col space
kernal space = null space, A invertible only iff kernal space {0}
both subspace
